# Example-Survey-Form
This is a design for a survey form.
I made this as a project for the freeCodeCamp responsive web design certificate. It showcases my abilty to create a good looking and usable form as well interesting feel to a webpage using the translating gradient background. The content of the form is purely aesthetic and it collects no data.
